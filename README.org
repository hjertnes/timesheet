* A commandline utility for keeping track of working horus. 
First real thing I wrote in Go.

- Cmd: this sets up the command line interface
- Runner: called by the Run functions in Cmd. Kind of like a command pattern interface. There is one function per command / sub command that actually does anything in the cmd interface.
